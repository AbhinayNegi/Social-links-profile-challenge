## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries

### What I learned

- I learned about flexbox layout. I made the card as flex container and its child flex element. I used flex direction to column so every element comes bottom of each other to achive the desired design.
- I also learned that if my decrease and increase my global font size it will also resize my entire element since I am using rem
- I learned about media queries to change the element size when viewing on larger device
- I learned about how to make button element to look as flat by making box-shadow: none;  border: 0;
